# Assignment 4

## Hierarchical Modeling and SSD

Name of Student: Prakriti Paudel

- Collaboration: I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment. All work was done individually.
- References: I took from several websites, discussion posts and YouTube videos for this assignment.
  -  https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2020/Skeletal-Animation
  -  Development session from Professor was very helpful
-  Known problems with the code: The joint rotations is slightly off for the mesh model. I think the order of matrix multiplications or improper handling of local and world space transformations is the issue but I could not figure it out properly.
-  Additional Comments about this assignment:
   - This assignment was a great learning experience and very challenging as compared to previous ones.
   - The instructions were clear, but I think I could improve on handling matrix stacks and transformations more efficiently if I had more time.
   - Overall, I learned a lot about OpenGL and how skeletal animation works in real-time rendering.
